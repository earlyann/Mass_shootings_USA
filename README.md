## Mass Shootings in the USA Visualization
This project visualizes the history and impact of mass shootings in the United States, using data from Kaggle's US Mass Shootings 1982-2023 dataset.

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive map that shows the location and details of mass shootings that have occurred in the United States from 1982 to 2023. The map is designed to provide a visual representation of the scope and impact of mass shootings in the country, and to raise awareness of the problem of gun violence.

### Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to create this visualization:
- Python/Pandas: for cleaning and saving the data to GeoJSON
- Leaflet.js: a JavaScript library for creating interactive maps
- D3.js: a JavaScript library for creating data visualizations
- HTML: the standard markup language for creating web pages
- CSS: a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML

### Instructions
To view the map, simply visit the Github Pages site for this project at https://earlyann.github.io/Mass_shootings_USA
